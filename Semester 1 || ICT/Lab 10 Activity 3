#Write a program that takes three numbers and prints their sum. Every number is given on a separate line

# Input three numbers from the user, each on a separate line
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum_of_numbers = num1 + num2 + num3

# Print the sum
print("The sum of the three numbers is:", sum_of_numbers)

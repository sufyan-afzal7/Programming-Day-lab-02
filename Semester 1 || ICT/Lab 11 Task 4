# Write a dummy authentication system program in which you accept user inputs for email and password. 
#Let's say the correct email and password are abc@gmail.com and abc respectively. 
#If the email and password entered are correct it should display “User is logged in”. 
#If the email is correct, then prompt the user that the password is not correct. 
#If the password is correct then prompt the user to enter the correct email. 
#If both are incorrect then display the corresponding message
